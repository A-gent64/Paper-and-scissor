# Paper-and-scissor
Paper and Scissors is a classic two-player hand game often used as a selection method in a similar way to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice. In the game, each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "paper," "scissors," and "rock." The possible outcomes are as follows:

Paper covers Rock: Paper wins against Rock.
Rock crushes Scissors: Rock wins against Scissors.
Scissors cut Paper: Scissors win against Paper.
